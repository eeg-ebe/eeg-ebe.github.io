        </h1><a name="what_is_HaplowebMaker"></a><h3><question>What is the purpose of the HaplowebMaker program?</question>
            </h3><answer>HaplowebMaker is a program capable of creating Haploweb representations from FASTA alignments.</answer>
        <a name="what_is_Haploweb"></a><h3><question>So and what is a Haploweb?</question>
            </h3><answer>Haplowebs are graphical representations. Haplowebs are haplotype networks that also show which haplotypes co-occur in at least one individual of the dataset. Haplowebs have been first purposed by Jean-Fran&#231;ois Flot in his paper
            <a href="https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-10-372">Haplowebs as a graphical tool for delimiting species: a revival of Doyle's "field for recombination" approach and its application to the coral genus <i>Pocillopora</i> in Clipperton</a></answer>
        <a name="how_does_it_work"></a><h3><question>How does it work?</question>
            </h3><answer>When the default settings are used, HaplowebMaker first calculates the evolutionary relationship of the sequences (haplotype network) via the Median-Joining-Algorithm. Afterwards the haplotype network gets visualized via a force directed graph drawing algorithm. Last, B&#233;zier curves are added in order to connect those haplotypes that co-occur in at least one individual in the dataset.<br /><br />However, the user has an influence on this procedure. Like this it is possible to choose another algorithm to calculate the evolutionary relationship.</answer>
        <a name="edit"></a><h3><question>Is there a way to edit/improve the created Haploweb representation?</question>
            </h3><answer>Yes, HaplowebMaker provides a specialized Image-editor that can get used to give each Haploweb a final touch. As HaplowebMaker creates standard svg-images, it is also possible to edit the created Haplotype images in programs (like Inkscape) that support this file type.</answer>
        <a name="cite"></a><h3><question>How should I cite this program?</question>
            </h3><answer>As this program was not published yet, you may cite it using the URL.</answer>
        <a name="input"></a><h1><name id="input">Questions concerning input files</name>
        </h1><a name="which_input_files"></a><h3><question>What kind of input files do I need?</question>
            </h3><answer>At least a FASTA alignment file is needed. However for more sophisticated haplowebs you may also need to provide a color file.</answer>
        <a name="input_file_fasta_alignment"></a><h3><question>What information is stored in the FASTA alignment file? / How does the FASTA alignment file has to be organised?</question>
            </h3><answer>The FASTA alignment file needs to list every sequence in your dataset. Furthermore the description/header/names of each sequence (or however you call the &gt;-line in a FASTA file that comes before a certain sequence) needs to follow certain rules, so that HaplowebMaker knows which sequences co-occur in which individual. More precisely the header of each sequence should follow the pattern <code>XXX_Y</code>, where <code>XXX</code> represents the name of each individual and <code>Y</code> a number, letter or any other symbol of your choice.<br /><br />Example:<br /><code>&gt;Anton_a<br />ACTGTCA---ACTGATGC<br />Anton_b<br />TAACGT----ACTGATGC<br />&gt;Berta_1<br />ACTA----CTGAACTATG<br />Berta_2<br />ACTA---ACTGAACTATG</code><br /><br />(Here, HaplowebMaker knows that the two sequences <code>ACTGTCA---ACTGATGC</code> and <code>TAACGT----ACTGATGC</code> co-occur in the same individual named "Anton" as both sequences share the same substring before the <code>_</code> delimiter.)</answer>
        <a name="input_file_fasta_alignment_y_part"></a><h3><question>Why do I have to specify this "_Y" part in my FASTA alignment files?</question>
            </h3><answer>To ensure that the individual sequence headers remain distinguishable. So be sure to use a different character for every sequence (HaplowebMaker does not enforce this). Otherwise you may have to guess which sequence HaplowebMaker is referring to when it tells you that sequence <code>XXX_a</code> is represented by circle <code>C</code> in the haploweb image.</answer>
        <a name="input_file_fasta_alignment_homozygous_individuals"></a><h3><question>So this "_Y" part in my FASTA alignment file is to ensure that the individual sequence headers remain distinguishable. However I want to add a homozygous individual to my dataset. So there is no "second sequence". Do I nevertheless have to add that "_Y" part?</question>
            </h3><answer>AS LONG AS the name itself does NOT contain any <code>_</code> characters, the "_Y" part can be omitted. In this kind of situation homozygous individual can be specified in three different ways (Let's assume, that the individual has the name "Charlie", then you could use <br /><code>&gt;Charlie<br />ACTG</code><br /> or <br /><code>&gt;Charlie_a<br />ACTG</code><br /> or <br /><code>&gt;Charlie_a<br />ACTG<br />&gt;Charlie_b<br />ACTG</code><br />. The last representation can be used in order to highlight that although the individual is homozyogus, it is till a diploid individual). If however the name of the individual contains a <code>_</code> character the "_Y"part becomes mandatory (so either use <br /><code>&gt;Charlie_Brown_a<br />ACTG</code><br /> or <br /><code>&gt;Charlie_Brown_a<br />ACTG<br />&gt;Charlie_Brown_b<br />ACTG</code><br />).</answer>
        <a name="input_file_fasta_multiple_delimiting_char"></a><h3><question>What happens if a sequence header contains multiple <code>_</code> characters?</question>
            </h3><answer>Then HaplowebMaker will use the last <code>_</code> character in order to split the sequence header. E.g. if you have <code>Charlie_Brown_sequenceA</code>, then HaplowebMaker will consider that <code>Charlie_Brown</code> is the name of the individual this sequence belongs to and that <code>sequenceA</code> is the part that you want to use in order to make this sequence distinguishable in comparison to other sequences from <code>Charlie_Brown</code> that co-exist in the dataset.</answer>
        <a name="input_file_fasta_no_delimiting_char"></a><h3><question>What happens if a sequence header does NOT contain any <code>_</code> characters?</question>
            </h3><answer>Then HaplowebMaker will consider that the sequence header is only indicating the individual name. And if your FASTA input file contains two different sequences with the same individual name, HaplowebMaker will think that this individual is heterozygous. (So yes, it is also possible to obmit the "_Y" part for heterozygous individuals, however then the haploweb analysis may become impossible.)</answer>
        <a name="input_file_fasta_other_delimiting_char"></a><h3><question>I do not like to use that <code>_</code> character. Can I also use another delimiting character?</question>
            </h3><answer>Yes. In the "Advanced settings" you can choose another delimiter character.</answer>
        <a name="input_file_fasta_space_beginning_ends"></a><h3><question>Can I add a space after each &gt; character in the FASTA alignment input file?</question>
            </h3><answer>Yes, HaplowebMaker ignores all spaces at the beginning and at the end of a sequence header.</answer>
        <a name="input_file_fasta_comments"></a><h3><question>Is it possible to add comments to my FASTA alignment files?</question>
            </h3><answer>Yes, HaplowebMaker supports comments in FASTA alignment files. HaplowebMaker ignores any line that is starting by a semicolon or a hashtag character.</answer>
        <a name="input_file_fasta_nuc_sequences"></a><h3><question>In all your examples you are only showing FASTA alignment input files with nucleotide sequences. Is it possible to use other sequences (e.g. binary sequence)?</question>
            </h3><answer>Till now, HaplowebMaker can only process nucleotide sequences.</answer>
        <a name="input_file_fasta_nuc_sequences_ambig"></a><h3><question>I have some ambiguous characters in my nucleotide sequence (R, Y, S, W, K, M, B, D H, V, N). How can I handle this kind of situation?</question>
            </h3><answer>By default, HaplowebMaker will moan about any ambiguous characters. The problem is, that such characters most often make the biological analysis of the resulting haplowebs unnecessarily complicated. It would be best if the FASTA alignment input file does not contain such ambiguous characters at all. However, via "Advanced settings" you can tell HaplowebMaker to handle such ambiguous characters differently.</answer>
        <a name="input_file_fasta_mult_nuc_sequence_for_one"></a><h3><question>I have a set of sequences for an individual. However some of the sequences in my set are certainly incorrect. However I do not know which one. Should I pass all these sequences to HaplowebMaker?</question>
            </h3><answer>If you have (let's say) 5 different sequences for a diploid individual, you have 3 too much. And if you pass all these 5 sequences to HaplowebMaker, HaplowebMaker will consider that this individual is 5-ploid. This is probably not what you want.</answer>
        <a name="multi_upload_input_file_fasta"></a><h3><question>I want to get haploweb representations for a bunch of files. How can I do this most effectively?</question>
            </h3><answer>Just upload all FASTA alignment files at once. (Still be sure that your browser will not run out of memory.)</answer>
        <a name="input_color_file"></a><h3><question>I want to specify the colors, HaplowebMaker should use in order to color the Haploweb. How can I do this?</question>
            </h3><answer>You need to pass a color file to HaplowebMaker.</answer>
        <a name="input_color_file_orga"></a><h3><question>What information is stored in the color file? / How does the color file has to be organised?</question>
            </h3><answer>The color file is a tab separated file mapping a color to an individual (or to a sequence). So each line in that file is following the format IndividualName Tab ColorName.</answer>
        <a name="input_color_file_color_names"></a><h3><question>Which color names are supported by HaplowebMaker?</question>
            </h3><answer>HaplowebMaker supports colors the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">140 html color names</a>. Furthermore it is possible to specify a color via their <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp">rgb()</a>, rgba(), <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp">hsl()</a>, hsla(), #XXX and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp">#XXXXXX</a> representations.</answer>
        <a name="input_color_file_spaces_in_color_names"></a><h3><question>Can I insert spaces in these color names, e.g. "Alice Blue" instead of "AliceBlue"?</question>
            </h3><answer>Don't do this. The color strings are interpreted by the webbrowser. Most webbrowsers don't support spaces in color names and will return black for a color name that they do not know.</answer>
        <a name="find_color"></a><h3><question>Ok, I know which color I want to have but how can I find it's #XXXXXX representation?</question>
            </h3><answer>Use a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">color chooser</a>.</answer>
        <a name="alpha_channel"></a><h3><question>Is it a good idea to specify a color with alpha channel?</question>
            </h3><answer>The alpha channel will make your color transparent (or semi transparent). You probably don't want to have invisible circles in your haploweb, so no, in general this is not a good idea.</answer>
        <a name="find_color"></a><h3><question>So how many colors can I specify?</question>
            </h3><answer>16777216 (without considering alpha channel).</answer>
        <a name="color_mix"></a><h3><question>In art, I learned that red, yellow and blue are primary colors. Why do I need to specify my color by using red, green and blue?</question>
            </h3><answer>Red, green and blue are the primary colors for light. Computer screens mix light together, not watercolors (That's why you do not have to refill any paint when using a screen).<br /><br />What you learned in art is not wrong. The only problem is that watercolors (where indeed red, yellow and blue would be the primary colors) are mixing differently then light (Watercolors: Mix all colors together and you are getting black; Light: Mix all colors together and you are getting white).</answer>
        <a name="web_safe_color"></a><h3><question>Should I use web safe colors only?</question>
            </h3><answer>The term "web save color" dates from a time, where most computers could not display more then 256 colors. With a reasonably modern computers there is no need to adhere to this limitation this limitation anymore.</answer>
        <a name="color_look_diff"></a><h3><question>Ok, so I choose this great looking color. But it is looking a bit differently on the screen of my cooperator. What can be the reason?</question>
            </h3><answer>Monitor construction differences can be the reason (e.g. glossy versus matte). Furthermore monitors have color settings. For example, the set  brightness can make colors appear brighter or darker.</answer>
        <a name="file_endings"></a><h3><question>Which line endings should I use for my input files?</question>
            </h3><answer>Unix (\n) and Windows (\r\n) line endings both work fine. However HaplowebMaker cannot handle the deprecated Macintosh line endings (\r) or the AIX OS line endings (\025). (Congratulations, if you still have any legacy software that can handle files with Macintosh and/or AIX OS file endings.)</answer>
        <a name="file_encoding"></a><h3><question>Which character encoding should I use for my input files?</question>
            </h3><answer>The de facto internet standard encoding: UTF-8.</answer>
